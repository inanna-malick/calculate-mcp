# Claude Code Handoff: compute-mcp Development

## Current State

You're picking up development of `compute-mcp`, a minimal arithmetic MCP tool created as a blog post example. The project is **fully implemented but not yet built or tested**.

## Immediate Actions Required

```bash
cd /Users/inannamalick/claude_accessible/compute-mcp

# 1. Build the project
cargo build --release

# 2. Run tests
cargo test

# 3. If tests pass, initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial compute-mcp implementation with direct JSON-RPC handling"
```

## Project Structure

## Key Implementation Details

### Critical Pattern Discovery
The previous thread discovered that **mcpr 0.2.3 does NOT provide high-level APIs**. You must use direct JSON-RPC handling. This pattern is validated in both `kv-memory-mcp` and `popup-mcp`.

### MCP Tools Implemented
1. **evaluate** - Single arithmetic expression
2. **evaluate_batch** - Multiple expressions
3. **history** - Last 100 calculations

### Grammar (compute.pest)
Minimal arithmetic with correct precedence:
- Operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Parentheses for grouping
- Decimal and negative number support

## Testing Claude Desktop Integration

After successful build, add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "compute": {
      "command": "/Users/inannamalick/claude_accessible/compute-mcp/target/release/stdio_direct"
    }
  }
}
```

## Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Path Dependencies**: If build fails, check that all imports are correct
2. **Pest Grammar**: The grammar file must be in the correct location (`src/compute.pest`)
3. **Binary Name**: The actual binary is `stdio_direct`, not `compute-mcp`

## Development Log

A complete development log is available at:
- Artifact ID: `compute-mcp-dev-log` (in Claude.ai)
- Contains full technical journey including error discovery and fixes

## Blog Post Context

This is designed as a minimal example for a blog post about building MCP tools. Key teaching points:
- Start with a simple, focused tool (arithmetic only)
- Use Pest for grammar-based parsing
- Property tests ensure correctness
- Direct JSON-RPC handling gives full control

## Thread Handoff Data

Previous thread stored experiment data in Prism:
```
experiments.compute_mcp = {
  status: "ready_for_build_and_test",
  goal: "minimal arithmetic MCP for blog post",
  architecture_change: "Switched from high-level mcpr API to direct JSON-RPC"
}
```

## Next Steps After Build

1. Test the MCP server manually:
   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}' | cargo run --bin stdio_direct
   ```

2. Run property tests specifically:
   ```bash
   cargo test --test property_tests
   ```

3. If everything works, consider extending:
   - Add modulo operator (%)
   - Add math constants (pi, e)
   - Add functions (sin, cos, sqrt)
