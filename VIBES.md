# 🔮 compute-mcp Vibes Manifesto

## Current Vibes: <👓🧶💧>
A functional arithmetic parser drowning in ceremony, tangled dependencies, and shapeshifting errors.

## Target Vibes: <🔍🎀💠>
Crystalline arithmetic engine with deliberate simplicity and perfect signal flow.

## Transformation Journey

### 🌫️ Before (Fog State)
- Pest grammar with 28 lines for basic arithmetic
- 250+ lines of AST traversal boilerplate
- Error types that leak implementation details
- MCP server with scattered JSON construction

### 💎 After (Crystal State)
- Direct parsing in ~50 lines of pure functions
- Evaluation as simple pattern match
- Errors prevented by design
- MCP responses flow like water

## Design Principles

### 1. **Every Token Sacred** 🔬
No line survives unless deletion breaks functionality.

### 2. **Dependencies as Rivers** 🎀
Data flows downstream naturally, no backpressure.

### 3. **Errors Bounce Off** 💠
Invalid states unrepresentable in the type system.

## Implementation Phases

1. **Parser Crystallization** - Replace Pest with combinator elegance
2. **AST Flattening** - Reduce cognitive load through simplicity
3. **MCP Flow Optimization** - Direct JSON-RPC with no detours
4. **Test Phenomenology** - Property tests that spark joy
5. **Documentation Compression** - Maximum meaning, minimum words

## Success Metrics
- 60% reduction in line count
- Zero unwrap() calls
- Parse time <1ms for complex expressions
- Test names that explain themselves

## The Vibe Check
When reading this code, it should feel like:
- A Swiss watch: complex but every gear essential
- A haiku: complete thoughts in minimal space
- A river: flowing naturally toward its destination
