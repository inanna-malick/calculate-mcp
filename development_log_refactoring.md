# Development Log: Refactoring compute-mcp for Production Quality

## Session Overview
**Date**: January 2025  
**Focus**: Refactoring compute-mcp from prototype to production-ready code  
**Key Achievement**: Transformed direct evaluation into AST-based parsing with comprehensive error handling

## Initial State Analysis

When we began, the codebase had several issues that needed addressing:

1. **Panic-prone code**: Multiple `unwrap()` calls that could crash the MCP server
2. **Tight coupling**: Parser directly evaluated expressions during parsing
3. **Limited error context**: Generic "InvalidStructure" errors without helpful details
4. **Test organization**: All tests inline in `lib.rs`, with duplicates across files
5. **Test patterns**: Tests using index-based access into result vectors

## Major Refactoring Decisions

### 1. AST-Based Architecture

The most significant change was introducing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation:

```rust
pub enum Expr {
    Number(f64),
    Add(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),
    Sub(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),
    Mul(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),
    Div(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),
    Neg(Box<Expr>),
}
```

**Why this matters**: 
- **Separation of concerns**: Parsing and evaluation are now distinct phases
- **Extensibility**: Adding new operations or transformations is straightforward
- **Debugging**: Can inspect/manipulate the AST before evaluation
- **LLM-friendly**: The AST can be serialized/pretty-printed for analysis

### 2. Error Handling Philosophy

We eliminated all `unwrap()` calls in production code, replacing them with proper error propagation:

```rust
// Before
.unwrap()

// After  
.unwrap_or_else(|e| {
    serde_json::json!({
        "error": format!("Failed to serialize response: {}", e)
    })
})
```

**Key insight**: For an MCP server, graceful degradation is critical. A panic in the server breaks the entire integration with Claude Desktop.

### 3. Enhanced Error Context

The `InvalidStructure` error was enhanced to include specific context:

```rust
// Before
InvalidStructure,

// After
InvalidStructure { context: String },
```

This provides actionable error messages like:
- "Expected right operand after + or - operator"
- "Unknown operator '&' in additive expression"
- "Expected inner expression in parentheses"

**Why this helps**: When an LLM receives these errors, it can understand exactly what went wrong and potentially fix the expression.

### 4. Pretty Printer Design

We implemented a simple pretty-printer that always adds parentheses:

```rust
match self {
    Expr::Add(left, right) => format!("({} + {})", left.to_string(), right.to_string()),
    // ...
}
```

**Design choice**: We opted for maximum clarity over minimal parentheses. This ensures:
- Unambiguous parsing
- Clear precedence visualization
- Successful round-trip property testing

### 5. Test Organization Strategy

Tests were reorganized into focused files:
- `expression_tests.rs` - Expression type and pretty-printing
- `evaluation_tests.rs` - Core arithmetic evaluation
- `parsing_tests.rs` - Parse error cases
- `batch_tests.rs` - Batch evaluation API
- `ast_tests.rs` - AST construction and manipulation
- `integration_tests.rs` - MCP server integration scenarios
- `property_tests.rs` - Mathematical properties and round-trip tests

**Benefits**:
- Faster test runs (can run specific test files)
- Clearer test intent
- Easier to find and add related tests
- No more duplicate tests

### 6. Test Pattern Improvements

We refactored from index-based testing to iteration-based patterns:

```rust
// Before
assert_eq!(results[0].value.as_ref().unwrap(), &5.0);
assert_eq!(results[1].value.as_ref().unwrap(), &50.0);

// After
let test_cases: Vec<(&str, Result<f64, ComputeError>)> = vec![
    ("2 + 3", Ok(5.0)),
    ("10 * 5", Ok(50.0)),
];

for ((expr_str, expected), result) in test_cases.iter().zip(results.iter()) {
    match (&result.value, expected) {
        (Ok(actual), Ok(expected)) => assert_eq!(actual, expected),
        // ...
    }
}
```

This pattern is more maintainable and provides better error messages.

## Technical Insights

### Parser Flexibility
The Pest parser remains unchanged but now feeds into AST construction. This layered approach means we can:
- Add optimization passes over the AST
- Implement constant folding
- Add type checking for future extensions

### Error Type Design
Using Rust's type system to model domain errors proved valuable:

```rust
enum ComputeError {
    ParseError(pest::error::Error<Rule>),
    InvalidNumber(std::num::ParseFloatError),
    DivisionByZero,
    InvalidStructure { context: String },
    EmptyExpression,
}
```

Each variant represents a specific failure mode, making error handling explicit and exhaustive.

### Property Testing Value
The round-trip property test caught edge cases in the pretty-printer:

```rust
fn round_trip_pretty_print(expr in arb_expr()) {
    let ast = parse_expression(&Expression::from(&expr))?;
    let pretty = ast.to_string();
    let reparsed = parse_expression(&Expression::from(&pretty))?;
    // Verify evaluation results match
}
```

This ensures our pretty-printer generates valid, parseable expressions.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with strong types**: The `Expression` newtype and `Expr` AST provide compile-time guarantees
2. **Error context is crucial**: Especially for LLM consumers who need to understand failures
3. **Separate concerns early**: Parser → AST → Evaluator is cleaner than Parser+Evaluator
4. **Test organization matters**: Well-organized tests are easier to maintain and extend
5. **Property tests find bugs**: Round-trip testing revealed issues unit tests missed

## Future Considerations

With this refactored foundation, the codebase is ready for:
- Additional operators (%, ^, etc.)
- Variables and functions
- Optimization passes
- Alternative output formats
- Performance improvements via AST memoization

## Conclusion

This refactoring session transformed a working prototype into production-ready code. The key was systematic improvement:
1. Identify anti-patterns (panics, tight coupling)
2. Design better abstractions (AST, error types)
3. Implement incrementally with tests passing
4. Refactor tests for maintainability

The result is code that's not just correct, but also maintainable, extensible, and debuggable. The AST-based approach particularly shines for an MCP tool that might be consumed by LLMs - they can better understand structured errors and potentially generate fixes.
